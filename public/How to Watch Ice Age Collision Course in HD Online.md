If you want to know more about the plot of Ice Age: Collision Course, here is a brief summary:
 
The film begins with Scrat, the squirrel, chasing his acorn into a spaceship that launches him into outer space. There, he causes a series of cosmic events that send a giant asteroid hurtling towards Earth. Meanwhile, on Earth, Manny, the mammoth, is worried about his daughter Peaches' upcoming wedding to Julian, a mammoth who loves to explore. Diego, the saber-toothed tiger, and his wife Shira want to have children, but they scare away the other young animals. Sid, the sloth, is dumped by his girlfriend Francine and feels lonely.
 
During Manny and Ellie's anniversary party, some of the asteroids strike the place and the herd barely escape. They meet Buck, the weasel, who has returned from the underground world with a stone pillar that shows a prophecy of the impending doom. Buck explains that they must go to a place called \"Geotopia\" where they can find a way to divert the asteroid. Along the way, they encounter a family of flying dinosaurs led by Gavin, who want to stop them from saving the world, believing that they will survive the impact.
 
In Geotopia, they meet a community of immortal animals who live in harmony with nature and crystals. The leader of Geotopia is Shangri Llama, a yoga-loving llama who guards a giant crystal that keeps everyone young and healthy. Sid meets Brooke, a female sloth who falls in love with him. Buck discovers that the crystal has the power to repel the asteroid if they use a volcano to launch it into space. However, this means that Geotopia will lose its eternal youth and beauty.
 
After convincing Shangri Llama and the others to sacrifice their immortality for the greater good, the herd and their new friends work together to prepare the crystal for launch. Meanwhile, Scrat returns to Earth with his spaceship and accidentally activates a self-destruct sequence that creates a massive explosion in space that pushes the asteroid away from Earth. The crystal also launches successfully and creates a force field that deflects any remaining debris.
 
The herd celebrates their victory and returns to their home. Peaches and Julian get married and decide to stay close to their parents. Diego and Shira become adoptive parents to three baby tigers who are not afraid of them. Sid and Brooke start a relationship and Francine tries to get back with Sid but fails. Scrat finally gets his acorn but loses it again when it falls into a volcano.
